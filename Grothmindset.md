## What I learned and understood is that there are two mindsets for people, one is a fixed mentality and the other is constantly growing

As for the fixed mentality, I understand that it stays in the comfort zone and does not learn anything new

As for the growth mindset, it always learns something new, is not afraid of failure, and has great persistence.

What I also learned is that what is responsible for success is not the level of intelligence of the person, but persistence and perseverance

Opportunities are also a factor that contributes to shaping an individual's life.
