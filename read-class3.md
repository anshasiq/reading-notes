## Difference between "int" and "Integer" in Java:

"int" is a primitive data type in Java, representing a 32-bit signed integer value.
"Integer" is a wrapper class that encapsulates an "int" value and provides additional methods and functionality.

## Default values:

The default value for "int" is 0.
The default value for "Integer" (which is an object) is null.

## Autoboxing and Unboxing:

Autoboxing: It's the automatic conversion of a primitive type (like "int") to its corresponding wrapper class (like "Integer") when needed. For example, assigning an "int" to an "Integer" variable.
Unboxing: It's the opposite process where the value is extracted from a wrapper class object and assigned to a primitive type. For instance, assigning an "Integer" to an "int" variable.

In summary, "int" and "Integer" are related but have differences in terms of being a primitive type versus a wrapper class. Autoboxing and unboxing are mechanisms that make it more convenient to switch between these two types seamlessly.

## Three basic categories of exceptions in Java:

Checked Exceptions
Unchecked Exceptions (RuntimeExceptions)
Errors

## Statement to handle an exception:

You can use a "try-catch" statement to handle exceptions in Java. The "try" block contains the code that might raise an exception, and the "catch" block contains the code to handle the exception if it occurs.

## Situation for using a Java program that scans text: When building a chatbot, you could use a program that scans user input to understand and respond appropriately to user queries and interactions.

## Input from a Scanner broken down into: The input from a Scanner is broken down into tokens. Tokens are the individual units of input separated by delimiters like whitespace, line breaks, or specific characters, depending on how you configure the Scanner.
